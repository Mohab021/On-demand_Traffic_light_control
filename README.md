# On-demand Traffic Light Control
Traffic lights are signaling devices positioned at road intersections, pedestrian crossings, and other locations to control the flow of traffic.  
The regular traffic light colors are red, yellow, and green arranged vertically or horizontally in that order.  
Crosswalk buttons let the signal operations know that someone is planning to cross the street, so the light adjusts, giving the pedestrian enough time to get across.  
On-demand Traffic Light Control Project runs on ATmega32 microcontroller.

## System Description
The purpose of this system is to simulate On-demand Traffic light control. The system runs on ATmega32 microcontroller and interacts with:
- Pedestrian press button: A button that when pressed simulates changing from Normal Traffic mode to Pedestrian Traffic mode.
- Car Green LED: A LED that acts like a Car Green Traffic Light
- Car Yellow LED: A LED that acts like a Car Yellow Traffic Light
- Car Red LED: A LED that acts like a Car Green Red Light
- Pedestrain Green LED: A LED that acts like a Pedestrain Green Traffic Light
- Pedestrain Yellow LED: A LED that acts like a Pedestrain Yellow Traffic Light
- Pedestrain Red LED: A LED that acts like a Pedestrain Red Traffic Light

## Getting Started
